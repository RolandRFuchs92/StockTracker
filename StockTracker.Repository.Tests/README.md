# StockTracker Repository

### General rules

1. Ensure that there is <b><i>no tight coupling</i></b> on any of the repository stuff.
2. <b><i>Test</i></b> everything that uses the data layer, its almost redunant but we just want basic validation, to catch little things that get through business logic. In a perfect world this should never happen but it can.
3. Enforce loose coupling.

### Objective 

This assembly is responsible for testing, catching, preventing and ensuring correct data storage and logging is enforced.

In addition there are a number of utilities that should be taken advantage of and need to be used to save time.
