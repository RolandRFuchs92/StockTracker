# StockTracker

This would be the first part of a bigger application.

The first objective is to create a central point to which managers, chefs, staff and any other personnel track what stock is required, and what the current par levels are.

This project would hopefully be able to cope in a production environment, but should also be a really good practical way to learn the ins and outs of understanding project development.

## Major points
1. Managers would log their max and min levels of stock, indicating what their expectations are.
2. Staff are to log in and capture the current stock levels at the bar. They would ideally count all stock.
3. When stock is finally captured and work is complete a service would be to create a shopping list based on the deficit of stock values.
4. The Managers of the store would be able to recieve the shopping list via the web App, SMS(if need be), Email, WhatsApp or other means of communcation.
5. The final option would be to integrate with various supplies and allow the system to automate the ordering process but get authorization from a manager.
6. Upon delivery of stock, members would simply add the delivered stock count to the current stock levels for the day.
7. This application will also support reporting, costing and user management. We want to give as much power to the client as possible.
